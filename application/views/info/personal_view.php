					<a> I believe my interest in web technologies and GIS can be attributed to the inherent front-end nature associated with these technologies.  
						My interest in web technologies, and the small amount of web related course work available, prompted me to create this website which has 
						been an excellent learning experience. However, course work in OO programming and physical geography stems from interests in math  
						and a love for the outdoors respectively. </a>

						these activities is very important to me, and I recieve great personal enjoyment from them. Other than this, I have a keen interest in 
						following the all blacks, the tour de france, tennis grand slams and Roger Federer.</a>
