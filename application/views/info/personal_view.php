					<p style='width:700px'> Growing up I have done a lot of road cycling, cricket, tennis and surfing. Keeping fit and the interaction with others which comes with
						these activities is very important to me, and I recieve great personal enjoyment from them. Other than this, I have a keen interest in 
						following the all blacks, the tour de france, tennis grand slams and Roger Federer.</p>

					<p style='width:700px'> Having played guitar for a number of years, I enjoy playing with friends or listening to my favourite artists. I also love good
						books, with particular emphasis on Bryce Courtenay, JR.Tolkien, Lance Armstrong novels and any african novel or autobiography. Working for the 
						Gisborne District Council, and their work with the Sustainable Coastlines group over summer also taught me the importance of
						responsible waste management, with a heavy on emphasis on recycling.   </p>
